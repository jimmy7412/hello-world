### Abstract
In 2005 a faint dwarf spheroidal galaxy was discovered in the Ursa Major constellation. Originally detected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to be an just an abnormal amount of red stars in a small area, a color magnitude diagram was performed and it was discovered to be remarkably similar to another dwarf galaxy in the proximity of the Milky Way. Upon further inspection this galaxy was determined to be about 100 kpc away and is fainter then the faintest previously known Milky Way galaxy. This new dwarf spheroidal galaxy likely has the lowest luminosity and surface brightness of any galaxy known to date.
